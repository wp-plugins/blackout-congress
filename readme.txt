Blackout Congress' IP addresses from visiting your site, and redirect them to the blackout protest page.

== Description ==

The protest begins Sunday May 31st at Midnight. Will you be ready?

Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to participate in protesting the renewal of the Patriot Act can install and activate this plugin to enqueue the Blackout Congress detection script.

The Blackout Congress detection script will block access to Congress' IP addresses and redirect them to the [blackout protest page](https://www.blackoutcongress.org/ "Blackout Congress Homepage").
